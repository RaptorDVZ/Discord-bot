# Discord-bot
discord bot 

This is the first discord bot created by me. 
The main functions that this bot can perform are:
  1. Delete messages which contains cuss words and warn the member that used them
  2. It can delete messages in bunch using [>clear {the no of messages to be deleted}] command
  3. Search for wikipedia summary
  4. warn members (without database storage)
  5. help command for more detail
 
 File is hosted in replit
 
 The token value is saved in an .env file that is present on replit (for security).
 
 I will add more features in future
 Thank you
